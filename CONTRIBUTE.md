# Contribute

Interesting would be interfaces to popular streaming services such as Spotify or Apple Music. After that, it would be nice to somehow summarize the results from all interfaces.

More concrete challenges will be named under "Issues".

Please note that there are no unit tests so far, so at this point one has to test all the features by hand.

## How to contribute

* Fork the project.
* Do your changes.
* Lint the code using flake8. (I use the python3.5 version.) Codes E501 and F821 can currently be ignored.
* Commit everything and make a pull request.
